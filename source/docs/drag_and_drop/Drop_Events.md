#HTML5 Canvas Drop Events with Konva

Konva does not support drop events. But you can write your own drop events detections.
To detect drop target shape you have to move dragging object into another layer.

In this example you can see implementation of `drop`, `dragenter`, `dragleave`, `dragover` events.

Instructions: drag one shape over another. Or drag and drop one shape into another.
