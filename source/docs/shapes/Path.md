title: HTML5 canvas SVG Path Tutorial
---

To create an SVG path with Konva, we can instantiate a `Konva.Path()` object.

Paths are most commonly used when we want to export an SVG Path into an HTML5 Canvas path, or if we want to manifest complex drawings as a data string rather than creating a custom shape.

For a full list of attributes and methods, check out the [Konva.Path documentation](/api/Konva.Path.html).
