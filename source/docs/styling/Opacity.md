title: Opacity Tutorial
---

To set a shape opacity with Konva, we can set the `opacity` property when we instantiate the shape, or we can use the `opacity()` method.

Shapes can have an opacity value between 0 and 1, where 0 is fully transparent, and 1 is fully opaque.  Unless otherwise specified, all shapes are defaulted with an opacity value of 1.

Instructions: Mouseover the pentagon to change its opacity.
