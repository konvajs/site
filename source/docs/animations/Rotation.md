title: HTML5 Canvas Konva Rotation Animation tutorial
---

To animate a shape's rotation with Konva, we can create a new animation with
`Konva.Animation`, and define a function which modifies the shape's rotation with each animation frame.

In this tutorial, we'll rotate a blue rectangle about the top left corner,
a yellow rectangle about its center, and a red rectangle about an outside point.

For a full list of attributes and methods, check out the [Konva.Animation documentation]/api/Konva.Animation.html).
