title: HTML5 Canvas Multi-Event Binding Tutorial
---

To bind multiple events to a single handler with Konva, we can use the `on()` method and pass in a space delimited string containing multiple event types.

Instructions: Mouseover, mousedown, and mouseup over the circle to observe that the function bound to the circle is executed for each event.
