title: Drag and Drop Collision Detection Demo
layout: demo_page

## How to find overlapping objects on the canvas?

In this demo we will use simple collision detection to highlight intersected objects.
For simplicity we will use just bounding boxes to detect collision.

Red borders are used to show bounding boxes.

Instructions: Drag and drop a shape, see collusion.
