title: Drag and Drop Collision Detection Demo
---

In this demo we will use simple collision detection to highlight intersected objects.
For simplicity we will use just bounding boxes to detect collision.

Red borders are used to show bounding boxes.

Instructions: Drag and drop a shape, see collusion.
