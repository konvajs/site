#HTML5 Canvas Complex Drag and Drop Bounds Tutorial with Konva

To bound the movement of nodes being dragged and dropped inside regions with
Konva, we can use the `dragBoundFunc` property to define boundaries that
the node cannot cross.

Instructions: Drag and drop the the light blue rectangle and observe that it
is bound below an imaginary boundary at y = 50. Drag and drop the yellow
rectangle and observe that it is bound inside of an imaginary circle.
