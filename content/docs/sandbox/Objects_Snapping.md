## How to snap draggable shapes to each other?

This demo will demonstrate how to implement snapping of objects to all edges of the stage on to all edges of other objects.

Also I found another related demos on the internet that may be useful:

2. Demo:https://codepen.io/pierrebleroux/pen/gGpvxJ

_Instruction:_ try to drag and object. See how it snaps to other objects.
