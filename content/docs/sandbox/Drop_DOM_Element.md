title: How to drag and drop DOM image into the canvas
layout: demo_page
---

In this demo we will demonstrate how drop DOM element that is placed outside of canvas into the stage.

The first image you see is a DOM image. We can use [HTML5 drag&drop](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/) to enable its dragging.

You will need some extra step if you need to enable drag&drop for DOM element on touch devices. You can read [here](https://mobiforge.com/design-development/touch-friendly-drag-and-drop) for more info.

Instructions: drag&drop yoda into the canvas.
