title: Interactive Scatter Plot with 20,000 Nodes
layout: demo_page
---

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the sheer number of nodes that Konva can handle by rendering 20,000 circles. Each circle is sensitive to mouseover events, and can be drag and dropped. This lab is also a great demonstration of event delegation, in which a single event handler attached to the stage handles the circle events.

Instructions: Mouse over the nodes to see more information, and then drag and drop them around the stage.
