title: HTML5 Canvas Blur Image Filter Tutorial
---

To apply filter to an `Konva.Image`, we have to cache it first with `cache()`
function. Then apply filter with `filters()` function.

To blur an image with Konva, we can use the `Konva.Filters.Blur` filter
and set the blur amount with the `blurRadius` property.

Instructions: Slide the control to adjust the blur radius.

For all available filters go to [Filters Documentation](/api/Konva.Filters.html).
