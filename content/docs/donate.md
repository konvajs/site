Hello, my name is Anton. I am core maintainer of `Konva` framework.

**If you want to support development of `Konva` and all its ecosystem tools like `react-konva` and `vue-konva` you can use:**

- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lavrton)
- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/konva)
- [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/lavrton)

I am spending a large amount of time to support `Konva` users and develop new versions with bugs fixes and new features.

If you are making money, by using `Konva` in your project, it makes sense to support `Konva` development. By doing this you will make sure that you have a good quality and maintained framework.

Even if you are not making money from your project but `Konva` saved you a lot of time, it will be very kind to support it.

### Your company is using Konva?

It may be hard for many developers to make a financial donation. But if you are using `konva` as part of your work in the company, talk to your managers to support the project. Well-supported project is a good value for the company.
