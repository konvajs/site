`react-konva` is a JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). It provides declarative and reactive bindings to the [Konva Framework](https://konvajs.org/).

[Github Repo](https://github.com/lavrton/react-konva)

It is an attempt to make [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) work with the HTML5 canvas library. The goal is to have a similar declarative markup as normal React and also a similar data-flow model.

**Currently, `react-konva` is not supported in the React Native environment.**

Currently you can use all `Konva` nodes and shapes as React components and all `Konva` events are supported on them in the same way.

**Note: you can find a lot of demos and examples for using Konva at [https://konvajs.org/](https://konvajs.org/). Really, just go there and take a look at what Konva can do for you. You will be able to do the same with react-konva, too. `Konva` for `react-konva` is like DOM for `React`.**

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-konva konva --save
```

Here's a basic example showing how to create a simple canvas with some shapes:

```js live react
import React from 'react';
import { Stage, Layer, Rect, Circle, Text } from 'react-konva';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Stage width={window.innerWidth} height={window.innerHeight}>
      <Layer>
        <Text text="Try to drag shapes" fontSize={15} />
        <Rect
          x={20}
          y={50}
          width={100}
          height={100}
          fill="red"
          shadowBlur={10}
          draggable
        />
        <Circle
          x={200}
          y={100}
          radius={50}
          fill="green"
          draggable
        />
      </Layer>
    </Stage>
  );
};

export default App;
```
